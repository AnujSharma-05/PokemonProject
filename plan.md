Step 1: Data Acquisition and Loading
This is where we'll start. The goal is to get your Pokémon dataset from Kaggle and load it into a format that Python can easily work with.

Action: Download your chosen Pokémon dataset from Kaggle.

Tool: The most common and effective tool for handling tabular data like a CSV file in Python is the pandas library.

How to do it:

First, you'll need to install the pandas library. You can do this with pip: pip install pandas.

In a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook, you'll import pandas: import pandas as pd.

Then, you'll use the pd.read_csv() function to load your dataset into a DataFrame, which is a powerful, table-like data structure. For example: df = pd.read_csv('pokemon.csv').

Once loaded, you can inspect the data using commands like df.head() to see the first few rows and df.info() to get a summary of the data types and non-null values.

Step 2: Creating Vector Embeddings
This step is crucial because it transforms your text-based data (the Pokémon names, types, strengths, etc.) into a numerical format (vectors) that a computer can understand and use for similarity searches.

Action: Convert the text fields of your DataFrame into vector embeddings.

Tool: You will use an embedding model, which is a type of AI model specifically designed for this task. The Gemini API provides a powerful embedding model (gemini-embedding-001) that is perfect for this.

How to do it:

You'll need to install the Google Generative AI SDK: pip install google-generativeai.

You will then use your Gemini API key to configure the SDK.

You can create a list of all the text you want to embed. For example, you might combine the 'Name', 'Type', and 'Strength' columns for each Pokémon into a single string.

Then, you'll call the genai.embed_content() method to generate the embeddings for all your text data. This will return a list of vectors.

Step 3: Vector Database and Retrieval
Now that you have your data as vectors, you need a place to store them and a way to efficiently search through them to find the most relevant information for a given user query. This is the core of the RAG "Retrieval" part.

Action: Store the vectors in a vector database and set up a retrieval mechanism.

Tool: There are many options, but for a project like this, a lightweight, in-memory database like ChromaDB or FAISS is a great place to start. They are easy to set up and don't require a complex server.

How to do it:

You'll install the chosen library, e.g., pip install chromadb.

You'll create a collection in the database and add your text chunks and their corresponding embeddings to it.

When a user asks a question (e.g., "What is the strength of Pikachu?"), you'll first convert their question into an embedding using the same model you used in Step 2.

Then, you'll perform a similarity search in your vector database to find the Pokémon data that is most "semantically similar" to the user's query.

Step 4: Generation and Front-end
This is the final step, where the retrieved data is used to "augment" the prompt for the Gemini model, allowing it to generate a natural, human-like response.

Action: Take the retrieved information and the original query, feed it to the Gemini model, and display the result.

Tool: The Gemini API itself.

How to do it:

You'll take the relevant information retrieved from your vector database (e.g., the name, type, and strength of Pikachu).

You will create a prompt that combines the user's question with this retrieved context. A good prompt might look something like: "You are a Pokémon expert. Based on the following information: {retrieved_data}, answer the question: {user_query}".

Finally, you will make an API call to the Gemini model with this augmented prompt, and the model will generate a response. You'll then display this response to the user. This is where you would build a simple front-end, like a command-line interface or a web page, to interact with your model.
